      <h1>New Year Dishes</h1>
      <p>Family is the basis of the Chinese society, which is seen through the significance placed on the New Year’s Eve dinner (年夜饭 / Nián yèfàn) or Reunion dinner (团年饭 / tuán niánfàn).</p>
      <p>This feast is extremely important to the Chinese. All family members must come back. Even if they truly can’t, the rest of the family will leave their spot empty and place a spare set of utensils for them.</p>
      <p>In the legend of the Spring Festival’s origin, this was when the monster Nian would come and terrorize the villages. The people would hide in their homes, prepare a feast with offerings to the ancestors and gods, and hope for the best.</p>
      <el-image src="https://chinesenewyear.imgix.net/assets/images/food/chinese-new-year-food-traditional-dinner.jpg?q=50&w=960&auto=format" fit='fill'></el-image>
      <p>Food is one of the things that the Chinese take the most pride in. And of course, lot of care and thought is put into the menu for the most important holiday of the year.</p>
      <p>As with Chinese New Year activities and decorations, the dishes are created to give blessings for the next year. Both the names and looks are symbols of wishes for prosperity, happiness and auspiciousness.</p>
      <p>Though every region (even household) have different customs, there are some common dishes seen on every table.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2>Spring Rolls</h2>
      <p>Eggrolls are probably the most well-known of Chinese cuisine. However, they’re actually “spring rolls.” They are eaten during the Spring Festival in Southern China to celebrate the coming of spring. More specifically, they are eaten on the first day of spring (立春 / lì chūn). They can appear on the table as a dinner dish, appetizer or snack</p>
      <el-image src="https://chinesenewyear.imgix.net/assets/images/food/chinese-new-year-food-spring-rolls.jpg?q=50&w=960&auto=format" fit='fill'></el-image>
      <p>Most are familiar with the deep fried version of spring rolls. Throughout China, they can also be steamed or baked. Size and shape vary from small rectangles to large flat circles.</p>
      <p>During the Jin Dynasty (circa 265–420), people would arrange spring rolls and vegetables together on a plate. This was known as the Spring Platter (春盘 / chūn pán). During the Spring Festival, emperors would award officials with Spring Platters. Each platter is said to have been worth thousands.</p>
      <p>Spring roll skins are made of flour, water and some salt. The filling depends on your personal taste. Traditionally, the filling is made of pork, Chinese cabbage, shiitake, carrots and seasoning.</p>
      <p>To make, create the filling of your choice. Place around 2 spoons onto the center of the spring roll skin. Tuck in the sides and roll it up, sealing the edges with egg whites. Finish by throwing them into the deep fryer until the skin is golden and crispy.</p>
      <el-divider></el-divider>

      <h2>Dumplings</h2>
      <p>Another well-known dish, dumplings are the northern equivalent of spring rolls. They are eaten during every special occasion, but are the most significant during Chinese New Year. That’s a lot of dumplings! But there’s good reason.</p>
      <el-image src="https://chinesenewyear.imgix.net/assets/images/food/chinese-new-year-food-dumplings.jpg?q=50&w=960&auto=format" fit='fill'></el-image>
      <p>In Chinese, dumplings 饺子 (jiǎo zi) sounds like 交子 (jiāo zi). 交 (Jiāo) means “exchange” and 子 (zi) is the midnight hour. Put together, jiāo zi is the exchange between the old and new year. All dumplings should be wrapped at this time. By eating dumplings, you are sending away the old and welcoming the new.</p>
      <el-image src="https://chinesenewyear.imgix.net/assets/images/food/chinese-new-year-food-dumplings-fried.jpg?q=50&w=960&auto=format" fit='fill'></el-image>
      <p>There are too many different types of filling to count. You can have whatever type of meat, vegetable and flavor you’d like.</p>
      <p>Typically, they include Chinese cabbage, green onion, pork and shrimp (similar to spring rolls).</p>\
      <p>In the Suzhou province, egg fillings are a must. The dumpling symbolizes the silver ingot, while the egg is gold. Meat and bamboo strip filling is called 丝丝齐齐 (sī sī qí qí), which means that everything needed will be available.</p>
      <p>Some people will also put a coin in a random dumpling. Whoever eats it will have great luck that year.</p>
      <p>In addition to the joy of eating delicious food, the making process is a family bonding activity too. During New Year preparations, every member of the family participates and wraps dumplings. In certain regions, the daughter-in-law must make a dumpling to be considered part of the family.</p>

      <h2>Noodles</h2>
      <p>In some places, it’s custom to cook dumplings and noodles together. This is called gold silk and gold ingots. It’s yet another dish to express people’s wishes for prosperity.</p>
      <p>Though the origin of noodles is heavily disputed, there’s no doubt that noodles are a staple in Chinese cuisine.</p>
      <el-image src="https://chinesenewyear.imgix.net/assets/images/food/chinese-new-year-food-noodles.jpg?q=50&w=960&auto=format" fit='fill'></el-image>
      <p>In the beginning, they were called “soup pancakes” (汤饼 / tang miàn). People would tear the dough into little pieces and throw them into the pot. It wasn’t until the Tang Dynasty when people began rolling them into the noodle shape we know today.</p>
      <p>They are also called 长寿面 (cháng shòu miàn), which means “longevity noodles.” You aren’t allowed to cut them and should try not to chew either. The longer the noodle, the longer your life will be. This calls for a lot of slurping.</p>
      <p>With noodles, there is great flexibility for sides and ingredients. Many vegetables and meats have symbolic meanings as well.</p>

      <h2>Hot Pot</h2>
      <p>For many, hot pot is the centerpiece of Spring Festival dinners.</p>
      <el-image src="https://chinesenewyear.imgix.net/assets/images/food/chinese-new-year-food-hot-pot.jpg?q=50&w=960&auto=format" fit='fill'></el-image>
      <p>Hot pot is another food that has a long history. Emperor Qianlong of the Qing dynasty is the most avid fan. When he held feasts for old and retired officials, hot pot with meat were always on the menu. During his New Year’s Eve dinner, there were 120 dishes for lunch and even more for hot pot.</p>
      <p>Despite being loved by commoners and royalty alike, hot pots are actually quite basic. It’s simply a bubbling pot and plates of uncooked meat and vegetables. You can choose whatever you like to throw into the pot. Wait until it’s cooked, take it out and eat.</p>
      <p>Part of the flavor comes from the broth you choose in the pot. The other part is your own dipping sauce. There are special hot pot sauces. You can also make your own using one raw egg, sesame paste, salt, sugar, cilantro and peppers. Hot pot is an extremely customizable dish. Everything mentioned in this article can be included, even the noodles!</p>
      <p>Some of the foods in this article, such as spring rolls and dumplings, can also be eaten outside of the main meal. Of course, there are many more <router-link to='/Snacks'>snacks</router-link> and <router-link to='/Desserts'>desserts</router-link> throughout the duration of the Spring Festival. As the TV Show “A Bite of China” (舌尖上的中国 / shé jiān shàng de zhōng guó) said, even if the other ancient traditions of the Spring Festival are modernized, the food culture will never disappear.</p>
